## Pure Functions

### Take a note that functions take argument

- By value:
  1. Strings, numbers etc..
- By reference
  1. Arrays
  1. Objects

### Pure Functios are:

- _Clean_:

  1. They do not change input data (and any other data)
  1. They always return the same data for the same input

- _Referencial Transparency_

  1. You can just put data instead of function

- _Memoizable_
  1.  You can save part calculations if you often use them

## High Order Functions

### Definition

Those are the functions which take functions and return a new one. Instead of make many function which are similar whe may build function like that:

### Code example 

```javascript
const reduce = (reducer, initial, arr) => {
	// implementation of Reduce ( Array Method )
	let result = inital;
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		result = reducer(result, arr[i]) ? result : arr[i];
	}
	return result;
};
const filter = (reducer, arr) => reduce(reducer, [], arr);
// funkcja znajdujÄ…ca element o najmniejszej wartoÅ›ci w duration
const shortest = filter((prev, next) => prev.duration < next.duration, songs);
const longest = filter((prev, next) => prev.duration > next.duration, songs);
```

Instead of all of this we can just use reduce and do this:

```javascript
const shortestReducer = (prev, next) =>
	prev.duration < next.duration ? prev : next;
const shortest = songs.reduce(shortestReducer, songs);
```

## Function Composition

### Problem 

Image we would like to add and then double the number

```javascript
const double = (y) => y * 2;
const add = (x) => x + 1;
```

### Solution

To ovoid nesting execution of those functions we can create **Function Composition**

```javascript
const compose = (...fns) => (value) =>
	fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), value);
```

Keep in mind that now we start execution from right to left

```javascript
add(add(double(2)));
// is equal to
compose(add, add, double);
```

If you would like to execute from left to right use .reduce instead.

## Currying

### Problem

Take a look at that functions:

```javascript
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
```

But what if we would like to use it in map function?

### Solution

1. We can do something like that
   ```javascript
   const double = multiply.bind(null, 2);
   [2, 10, 15].map(double);
   ```
1. Or use curying instead:

   ```javascript
   const multiply = (x) => (y) => x * y;
   /* 
        or to be more readable
    */
   function multiply(x) {
   	return function y() {
   		return x * y;
   	};
   }
   ```

   Thanks to the scope functiony has acces to multiple _x_.

### Use Case

We will use Ramda library.

```javascript
import { curry, compose, pipe } from "ramda";
function multiply(multiplier, value) {
	return multiplier * value;
}
const number = [1, 2, 4, 10];
const curiedMultiply = curry(multiply);
number.map(curiedMultiply(2)); // [2, 4, 8, 20];
```

Function curry makes currying function from binary function.
We have **strict currying** & **loose currying**

```javascript
curiedMultiply(2, 5) === curiedMultiply(2)(5);
```

So, we ha a list of books:

```javascript
const books = [
    { title: "Total Recall", pages: 593, genre: "biography"},
    ...
]
```

We would like to count number of pages of selected type of books with the help of composition and currying:

```javascript
const hasProperty = curry((property, value, obj) => obj[property] === value);
const getProperty = curry((property, obj) => obj[property]);

const getBusiness = (list) => list.filter(hasProperty("genre", "bussines"));
const getPages = (list) => list.map(getProperty("pages"));
const countPages = (book) => book.reduce((acc, pages) => acc + pages);

pipe(getBusiness, getPages, countPages)(books);
// pipe is like composition but calls functions in inverted way (first on left)
```

## Shared State

### Definition 

Is an info that we can access from many places in our app. To avoid many bugs in our programs, we should use:

```javascript
function app() {
	const items = ["a", "b", "c"];
	log(items);
	// something more
}
function log(items) {
	const arr = [...items]; // shallow
	// more actions...
}
```

Unfortunatelly its is shallow copying, so it won't copy deep functions from prototype ðŸ˜©.
So to copy deeply our objects we should implement our own funcitons or use library like Ramda with it's **_R.clone_** function. To make sure that your properties won't be modified use:

```javascript
Object.freeze(yourObject);
```

## Composition over inheritence

### Problem

Let's imagine we have 2 classes

```javascript
class Movie {
	record() {}
	share() {}
	watch() {}
}

class Podcast {
	record() {}
	share() {}
	listen() {}
}
```

As you can see we have similarity between those 2 classes. Let's implement inheritance

```javascript
class Media {
	record() {}
	share() {}
}
class Movie extends Media {
	record() {}
}

class Podcast extends Media {
	record() {}
}
```

Look great rigth?
But what when we will add Newsletter which we can also share?

```javascript
class Newsletter extends Media {
	write() {}
	read() {}
}
```

As you assume we have a problem because, we cannont record Newsletter. We can resolve it in that way

```javascript
class Resource {
	share() {}
}
class Newsletter extends Resource {
	// ... methods
}
```

But now we are not DRY. It is so called [_Duplication by necessity_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49002/prefer-composition-over-inheritance)

### Solution 

Let's take a look how we can use objects composition ti fight with our problem.

Inheritance focuses on **how our classes look like** instead of **what they can do**
We have our movie which can:

- record
- share
- watch

```javascript
const recordable = (state) => ({
	record: () => `I'm recording a new ${state.type}`,
});
const shareable = (state) => ({
	share: () => `I'm sharing a new ${state.name}`,
});
const watchable = (state) => ({
	watch: () => `I'm watching a new ${state.name}`,
});
// This is so called factory functions
const movie = (name) => {
	const state = { name: name, type: "movie" };
	return Object.assign(
		state,
		recordable(state),
		shareable(state),
		watchable(state)
	);
};

const latestMovie = movie("Composition vs. Inheritance");
```

Main idea of this topics is

> I believe in updates, not rewrites.

## Factory Functions

### Definition

Factory is an function that return an object. Good praxis is to frooze returned object. Object.freeze offers only short freeze, so if you will put nested objects it will not work for them.

### Code example 

```javascript
const list = () => {
	const items = [];

	return Object.freeze({
		// short freeze
		addItem: (item) => items.push(item),
		getItems: () => items,
	});
};
```

Take a note that each object has method, it is not connected to prototype object so it's not well optimized. On the other hand it's not big deal for even 100 objects.

## Functors

### Definiton

> Object which allow to map his atributes
> The simplest functor is array

### Rule 1 - identity

Object return by mapping should has the same structure as mapped functor.

### Rule 2 - composistion

We should be able to use interchangeable chaining and composistion

```javascript
const newTuple = (a,b) => {
    let tuple = {a: a, b: b}
    tuple.map = callback => newTuple(callback(tuple.a),callback(tuple.b))
    return tuple
}

/* identity */
const tuple = newTuple(4,3)
const tupleIdentity = tuple.map( x => x )

/* composistion|chaining */
const double = x => x*2
const increase = x => x+1
const tupleComposedFunctions = tuple.map( x => double(increase(x)) )
const tupleChainedMaps = tuple.map(increase).map(double)
```

## Monads

### Definition 

It alows to flatmap for some values. Flat map is like map but it flats nested array. So it is an functors which flatmap instead of map.

### Use Case

Let's imagine we are creating Fahrenheit to Celsius converter
```javascript
const fahrenheitToCelsius = (a) => (a-32)*0.5556;

const sensor1 = 15;
const sensor2 = null;

fahrenheitToCelsius(sensor1); /*?*/ - good value
fahrenheitToCelsius(sensor2); /*?*/ - bad value, because JS will treat null as 0
```

Let's create monads for handling corect and uncorect values.

```javascript

const Just = (x)=> ({
	map: (fn) => Just(fn(x)),
	flatmap: (fn) => fn(x),
	valuesOf: () => x,
	inspect: () => `Just(${x})`,
	type: "just"
})

const Nothing = ()=> ({
	map: (fn) => Nothing(fn()),
	flatmap: (fn) => fn(),
	valuesOf: () => Nothing(),
	inspect: () => `Nothing`,
	type: "nothing"
})

const MaybeOf = (x) => (x === null || x === undefined || x.type === 'nothing' ? Nothing() : Just(x));

const Maybe = {
	of: MaybeOf,
};
 /*********************************/

 const tem1C = Maybe.of(sensor1).map(fahrenheitToCelsios).inspect();
 const tem1C = Maybe.of(sensor2).map(fahrenheitToCelsios).inspect();
 ```

 It's save even for chaining!
